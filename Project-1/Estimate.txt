Estimates of  RTO and RPO on AZ/Region Outage
---------------------------------------------
Because or RDS architecture is having Primary Database deployed in Multi-AZ of the us-east-1 region. and also it has a read-replica setup in another region(eu-central-1), but still, if in case of outage(AZ or region), there will be some business impact, though it is considerably less and very unlikely. 

Given below are the Estimation of RTO and RPO specific to a Outage type. 

1. RTO/RPO Estimation when a single Availability Zone(AZ) is down. 
	i) AZ(RDS Active) of Primary Region is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Database Connections/transaction Started failing : 0 Minute
	   00:02 - When the Active RDS AZ is down, then as part of failover, the DB automatically switches to the standby AZ between 60-120 Sec, without any manual interaction. So no action needed. : 2 Minute
	  
   	   RTO: 5 Minute (maximum 5 min in worst case, the recovery will be made from the failure situation)
	   RPO: 5 Minutes (Maximum 5 minute, in worst case, data will be lost)
	   
   ii) AZ(RDS Standby) of Primary Region is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Standby Database is down because of the AZ outage : 0 Minute
	   00:00 - Problem Ends - As this is standby, hence there will be absolutely no impact at all as the Active Database in another AZ is up and running, So business as usual: 0 inute
	   
	   RTO: 0 Minute 
	   RPO: 0 Minutes
 
 iii) AZ(RDS Read-Replica Active) of Secondary Region is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Read Replica Database is down because of the AZ outage : 0 Minute
	   00:00 - Problem Ends - As this is Just Read Replica, hence there will be absolutely no impact at all as the Active Database in another region is up and running, So business as usual: 0 Minute
	   
	   RTO: 0 Minute 
	   RPO: 0 Minutes
   
   iv) AZ(RDS Read-Replica Standby) of Secondary Region is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Read Replica Database is down because of the AZ outage : 0 Minute
	   00:00 - Problem Ends - As this is Just Read Replica, hence there will be absolutely no impact at all as the Active Database in another region is up and running, So business as usual: 0 Minute
	   
	   RTO: 0 Minute 
	   RPO: 0 Minutes
	   
2. RTO/RPO Estimation when a single Region is down. 
	i) Primary Region(RDS Active) is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Database Connections/transaction Started failing : 0 Minute
	   00:05 - Being both the AZs down in the region, hence it's a severity/priority 1 situation, so there will be high alert to the on-call staff. : 5 Minute
	   00:10 - Take 10 minutes time for the On-Call Staff to get out of bed and login in the system: 10 Minute
	   00:20 - Takes 10 minute for the complete Diagnosis of the issue, Nothing(any of the AZ) is reachable in the Primary Region, hence he concluded it's a region outage: 15 Minute
	   00:30 - Stop the Application that connects with the outage/off-line Database : 5 Minute
	   00:35 - Find the Restoration Steps and checklist Document and prepare the plan to Route the Application traffic to the Secondary Region Database: 5 Min
	   00:45 - Promote the Secondary Region Read Replica Database as the Primary/Master DB and get the new Database Endpoint: 10 Min
	   00:55 - Update the Application to connect to the new master database endpoint and if needed, restart the application to reflect the change : 10 Minute
	   00:55 - Database Connection Restored and Application started communicating with the new Database for the read and write calls: 0 Minute
	   01:00 - Start Monitoring for few minutes and then communicate about the outage to the concerned departments and stake holders: 5 Minute. 
	   
	   RTO: 55 Minute (00:00 - 00:55)
	   RPO: 30 Minute (00:00 - 00:30)
	   
   ii) Secondary Region(RDS Read Replica) is down: 
	   00:00 - Problem Starts - Read Replica Database is down because of the Secondary Region outage : 0 Minute
	   00:00 - Problem Ends - As this is Just Read Replica, hence there will be absolutely no impact at all as the Active Database in another region is up and running, So business as usual: 0 Minute
	   
	   RTO: 0 Minute 
	   RPO: 0 Minutes
