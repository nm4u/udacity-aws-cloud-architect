NAT Gateway,NA,1,"As it's only needed for the private subnet components(EC2,DB) to connect to internet in case any sotware updates/installations needed, hence let's assume all together, there will be 100 GB Per month Usage.

CloudFront,"30000GB out to internet, 10000 GB to origin, 200 million http requests",1,"Based on Google search, on average, a user spent around 2.7 GB of usage per month in Social network. But because this company is new, initially let's assume 1 GB usage for each user per month, so 50,000 users use 50,000 GB in total including all get/post/put/delete calls etc. 40,000 GB are mostly get calls and 10,000 GB are other calls which travels to origin.
